To me the article has too many implementation details, that distract from the core message of the article, which would be performance and scaling with system size.







General remarks
 - Section 3 can be omitted entirely, in my opinion it is sufficient to state that the space is adaptively partitioned into 3d nodes/intervals. If necessary this chapter can be shortened and incorporated into Section 4




 - I also feel that Sec 2.1 could be better included in Sec. 4






 - The level of detail is unnecessarily high in Section 4, e.g. explaining the "compressed" and "reconstructed" tree states







 - The authors should always make clear what a "node" is: an MRA node (3d interval) or a compute node (possible also an MPI rank?). Also, they write about storing data "together" or "separately" which I assume refers to storing them on the same or different compute nodes? The same is true for statements that data are "locally accessible". This should be clarified.



 - Sec 4.2: the naming "MW nodes in real space" confuses me, but I cannot come up with a better suggestion.








Minor remarks:
 - Sec 2.1: What is the difference between "Product of two MW functions" and "Application of a multiplicative operator"?


 - Sec 2.1.1: derivatives are defined in a weak sense, but they are numerically not well-behaved.






 - Sec 2.1.2 and 2.1.3: summing and applying does not commute: is there any numerical difference between both approaches?








 - Eq. 17: \sum_p instead of \sum_k






Suggestions:
 - The authors state correctly that data sparsity comes with MRA, even if orbitals have non-vanishing contributions from all regions. This is an important statement and has implications for both performance and precision and could be placed more prominently.









 - The authors might mention that many first-order molecular properties, including gradients, can be computed at little extra cost via the Hellmann-Feynman theorem.





 - It would be interesting to see scaling properties with respect to MPI ranks and compute nodes for a given molecule/precision.
