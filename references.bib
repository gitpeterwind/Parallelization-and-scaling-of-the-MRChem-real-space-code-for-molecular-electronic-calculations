For a system of N particles, an amount of work of the order O(N2) has traditionally been required to evaluate all pairwise interactions, unless some approximation or truncation method is used. The algorithm of the present paper requires an amount of work proportional to N to evaluate all interactions to within roundoff error, making it considerably more practical for large-scale problems encountered in plasma physics, fluid dynamics, molecular dynamics, and celestial mechanics.}

We show how such a solver is inherently a preconditioned steepest descent method and therefore a good starting point for rapid convergence. A distinctive feature of our implementation is the absence of any reference to the kinetic energy operator. This is desirable when Multiwavelets are employed, because differential operators such as the Laplacian in the kinetic energy are challenging to represent correctly. The theoretical framework is described in detail and the implemented algorithm is both presented in the paper and made available as a Python notebook. Two simple examples are presented, highlighting the main features of our implementation: arbitrary predefined precision, rapid and robust convergence, absence of the kinetic energy operator.},

The key features of our approach that make it feasible, namely (1) low-rank tensor approximations of functions and operators and (2) analytic elimination of operator singularities via explicit correlation, were retained from the previous work [F. A. Bischoff, R. J. Harrison, and E. F. Valeev, J. Chem. Phys. 137, 104103 (2012)]. Here we generalized the working equations to handle general (non-symmetric) many-electron systems at the MP2 level. The numerical performance is shown for the beryllium atom and the water molecule where literature data for the basis set limits could be reproduced to a few tens of μEh. The key advantages of molecular MRA-MP2 are the absence of bias and arbitrariness in the choice of the basis set, high accuracy, and low scaling with respect to the system size.},

abstract = {A framework to calculate CC2 approximated coupled-cluster ground state correlation energies in a multiresolution basis is derived and implemented into the MADNESS library. The CC2 working equations are formulated in first quantization which makes them suitable for real-space methods. The first quantized equations can be interpreted diagrammatically using the usual diagrams from second quantization with adjusted interpretation rules. Singularities arising from the nuclear and electronic potentials are regularized by explicitly taking the nuclear and electronic cusps into account. The regularized three- and six-dimensional cluster functions are represented directly on an adaptive grid. The resulting equations are free of singularities and virtual orbitals, which results in a low intrinsic scaling. Correlation energies close to the basis set limit are computed for small molecules. This work is the first step toward CC2 excitation energies in a multiresolution basis.},

The pair-natural orbitals are expressed in an adaptive multiresolution basis and computed directly by iterative variational optimization. The approach is demonstrated by computing the second-order Moller–Plesset energies of small- and medium-sized molecules. The resulting MRA-PNO-MP2-F12 method allows for the first time to compute correlated wave functions in a real-space representation for systems with dozens of atoms (as demonstrated here by computations on alkanes as large as C10H22), with precision exceeding what is achievable with the conventional explicitly correlated MP2 approaches based on the atomic orbital representations.

The emphasis on hierarchical representations of functions on intervals helps to address issues of both high-order approximation and efficient application of integral operators, and the lack of regularity of multiwavelets does not preclude their use in representing differential operators. Comparisons with finite difference, finite element, and spectral element methods are presented, as are numerical examples with the heat equation and Burgers' equation.},

abstract = {{We have developed and implemented a general formalism for fast numerical solution of time-independent linear partial differential equations as well as integral equations through the application of numerically separable integral operators in d ≥ 1 dimensions using the non-standard (NS) form. The proposed formalism is universal, compact and oriented towards the practical implementation into a working code using multiwavelets. The formalism is applied to the case of Poisson and bound-state Helmholtz operators in d = 3. Our algorithms are fully adaptive in the sense that the grid supporting each function is obtained on the fly while the function is being computed. In particular, when the function g = O  f is obtained by applying an integral operator O, the corresponding grid is not obtained by transferring the grid from the input function f. This aspect has significant implications that will be discussed in the numerical section. The operator kernels are represented in a separated form with finite but arbitrary precision using Gaussian functions. Such a representation combined with the NS form allows us to build a sparse, banded representation of Green’s operator kernel. We have implemented a code for the application of such operators in a separated NS form to a multivariate function in a finite but, in principle, arbitrary number of dimensions. The error of the method is controlled, while the low complexity of the numerical algorithm is kept. The implemented code explicitly computes all the 22d components of the d-dimensional operator. Our algorithms are described in detail in the paper through pseudo-code examples. The final goal of our work is to be able to apply this method to build a fast and accurate Kohn–Sham solver for density functional theory.}},
